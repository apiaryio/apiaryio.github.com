Once again, this years installment of [RESTfest][] fanned the flames of API designers, developers, consumers and 
evangelists alike. As an unconference where everyone presents on anything, you never really know what you are in store 
for and the fun is to see completely disparate people, from all spectrums of expertise, explore the space of REST and 
APIs. 

A [Hypermedia API "bake off"][] kicked off the weekend. Our friend [@lukestokes][] whipped up an [API blueprint][] on 
the fly for our team. Unfortunately, technical difficulties (mine) hampered our glorious plans. Such is life on a 
Hackday.

No surprise that Hypermedia was a hot topic. What was surprising were the common themes about tooling and design. 
Instead of focusing on protocols and media-types, a common thread was designing and implementing Hypermedia APIs 
as semantically rich state machines. A number of us at Apiary have been exploring new design tools as well as 
client and server-side tooling based on state-machines for a while, so it was encouraging to see others progress in
the area. 

Simple, human-friendly API design tools were another hot topic. From simple ways to semantically describe resources and
data structures, integrated API validation and exploring/visualizing APIs in ways that are friendly to non-technical 
business stakeholders were the order of the day. Many were in search of such tooling and a few, like ourselves, are 
actively working on it. 

All in all, great people, great discussions and plethora of cool, practical ideas around the future of APIs. If you 
have a chance to attend next year, I highly recommend it.
