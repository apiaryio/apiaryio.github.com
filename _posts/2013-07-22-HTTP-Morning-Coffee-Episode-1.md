_This post is part of our new series Morning Coffee where people behind Apiary briefly discuss their thoughts on everything API. This time, it is [@ntmlk](https://twitter.com/ntmlk) and [@zdne](https://twitter.com/zdne), high on a morning coffee:_

## Discussion
+ Discussing **NodeUp** podcast [episode forty four](http://nodeup.com/fortyfour)
+ Rails-ism and how Rails shaped the world of Web APIs
+ [@dhh](https://twitter.com/dhh) (and Rails) have done an incredible great service for the API community 
+ Unfortunately they have also committed a **major crime**
+ They tied a representation of resource with the URI space
+ They built the REST engine on top of the URI space and routing DSL
+ Modeling URI is irrelevant, the URI space could be flat
+ Modeling URI It is just a matter of aesthetics 
+ For the same reason [@steveklabnik](https://twitter.com/steveklabnik) is wrong in [A digression about actions](http://blog.steveklabnik.com/posts/2011-07-03-nobody-understands-rest-or-http#a_digression_about_actions) section of his, otherwise brilliant article.
+ It is good to have a nice and tidy URI space but one shouldn't design his or her API around it

## Steps to reproduce
+ 35g of NDIMAINI AA, [Square Mile Coffee Roasters](http://squaremilecoffee.com)
+ Chemex
+ 500g water at 90Â°C
+ 30sec pre-infusion 
+ 3min extraction
