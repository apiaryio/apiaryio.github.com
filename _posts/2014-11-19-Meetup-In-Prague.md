After exactly two months since our [first meetup](http://blog.apiary.io/2014/09/19/Apiary-Meetup) at San Francisco, we decided to host our second meetup in our very own home country, Prague. The agenda of the event was simple, meet the Apiary team and enjoy some good food and beer :)

It was great to see such a huge turnout at Node5. There were close to 50 people attending the event leading to really interesting conversations. The first 20 registrants were also "awarded" with our cool Apiary T-shirts.

The discussion for the evening started with Andrew, VP of enterprise products, introducing our [recently launched](http://blog.apiary.io/2014/10/22/Enterprise-Release/) Apiary for Enterprise product. Andrew presented live demo of the product and answered some great questions from the audience.

Adam, the man behind Dredd, touched on API testing and how it integrates with API Blueprint.
