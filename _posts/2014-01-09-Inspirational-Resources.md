Everybody needs an inspiration. Moreover when on the quest for a better API. Inspiring or offending, instructive or just simply time saving – it is often worth looking how others dealt with the challenges one have to face. 

I have prepared a brief compilation of  API designs – open sourced blueprints, Apiary users have created. 

Bellow you can find a short list of selected blueprints alongside with notes on some perks of the respective API designs. Each entry includes a link to the blueprint in its GitHub repository as well as a link to load it directly into editor at [Apiary.io](http://apiary.io). 

*Note: You need to be signed in to Apiary in order view the blueprint in the editor*

## Selected API blueprints:

- [**GHD Registration Portal**](https://github.com/worldspawn/apiary/blob/master/apiary.apib)
 
	*application/hal+json, error codes, URI parameters, resource description, resource model*
	
- [**H2O REST API**](https://github.com/mmalohlava/babylon4apiaryio/blob/master/apiary.apib)

	*error codes, URI parameters*
	
- [**Open Ed**](https://github.com/openedinc/openedapi/blob/master/apiary.apib)

	*authentication, error codes, URI parameters*

- [**Appliance API**](https://github.com/t0mpr1c3/homenet-apib/blob/master/apiary.apib)

	*exemplar collection and item resource design, URI parameters*

- [**POD API**](https://github.com/dwcaraway/podserve/blob/master/apiary.apib)

	*exemplar collection and item resource design, URI parameters*

- [**Notificare Push API**](https://github.com/Notificare/apiblueprint/blob/master/apiary.apib)

	*exemplar collection and item resource design, nested resources, URI parameters*

- [**Tesla Model S REST API**](https://github.com/timdorr/model-s-api/blob/master/apiary.apib)

	*a car with an API!*

- [**Helpful API**](https://github.com/asm-helpful/helpful-web/blob/master/apiary.apib)

	*custom media type based on application/hal+json, HTTP link header, authentication, resource description, URI parameters, resource model, exemplar collection and item resource design, apparently work in progress*

In addition to these blueprints there are always official [API Blueprint Examples](https://github.com/apiaryio/api-blueprint/tree/master/examples) available. For example the [**Gist Fox API**](https://github.com/apiaryio/api-blueprint/blob/master/examples/Gist%20Fox%20API.md)

Hope you were able to find some inspiration or answer to your questions. But don't get carried away for too long. Crafting actual API has never been easier!
