Everyone knows manual testing is a huge drag and incredibly time consuming. This is why test automation has been become such the norm. At Apiary, we’ve have made it our duty to streamline such exhausting tasks, especially when it comes to designing and developing APIs. Sure, we made it easy for you to quickly design, prototype and document your APIs, but we were missing one pretty important piece to completing our platform of tools for the API design lifecycle — the ability to test API specification and documentation against its backend implementation. So, well over a year ago, one of our brave engineers set out on an adventurous task to solve this problem by inventing Dredd, an open source HTTP API testing framework.

Our buddy Dredd has been such a huge hit within the open source community, but we decided to take it one step further and integrate our open source HTTP API testing framework with Continuous integration. This is such an amazing complishment for us and for the API design industry.
