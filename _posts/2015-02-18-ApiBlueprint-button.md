In the last times we have received a lot of feedback from users that would like to learn more about API Blueprint and how to present stunning and beautiful documentation for their users.

We care about your feedback and we think that documentation and tutorials about [API Blueprint](http://apiblueprint.org) are extremely important. Given that we're hard working on this, and that tons of stuff is coming, today I am glad to announce that we've made another step forward in that direction.

One of the most requested feature was the ability to look to the other APIBlueprint as a source of inspiration from that, and today this is possible, according to your API Blueprint sharing policies.

Whenever you're surfing a public API Blueprint, a new **API Blueprint** button will appear on header bar. Clicking on that will open up a new window with raw source code, that can be easily grabbed, studied, modified and republished as well.

Sharing your API Blueprint with the community is very easy. Just go to your API settings and ensure that 'Public Blueprint' switch is turned on.

We're not goint to stop here anyway. As next step, we want (and we will) to merge this experience with our powerful editor so that in a single click, you can edit the blueprint using our powerful tools.

What are you waiting for? Share your blueprint with the community now!
