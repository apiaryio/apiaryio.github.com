<h1>To Our Wonderful Beta-Testers</h1>

<p>We've been working very hard for the last few months to bring you the best tools for your REST APIs out there. And we couldn't have done it without our amazing beta testers. We'll be releasing Apiary publicly soon, but before that happens, I wanted to thank you all for being such a great help to us. And since we've added so much to the original product based on your feedback, I wanted to take a minute to bring you up to speed with everything that's new in Apiary.</p>

<h1>What's New</h1>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Proxy + Pass-Through</strong> - In addition to providing a mock server based on your API documentation, we've added a transparent HTTP proxy. Your API users can now access your real API server through Apiary and get all the benefits of visualising their API usage and comparing it to the provided documentation. Most recently we've started proxying all traffic to your API, even those resources that are not documented yet. This can be a great help in identifying and fixing gaps in your documentation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>JSON Schema support</strong> - Sometimes comparing the data that your customers are sending to the documentation in a simple text diff is simply not sufficient to help your users debug the problem. We've added support for describing your data structures using JSON Schema. Your documentation can now have integrated data validation directly embedded! We're currently trying this out, if your interested in trying this out then <a href="http://apiary.io/team">talk to us</a>.</p>
