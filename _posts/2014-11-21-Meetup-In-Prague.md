Exactly two months after the [first meetup](http://blog.apiary.io/2014/09/19/Apiary-Meetup) in San Francisco, we decided to host second one in our very own home country, **Prague**. The agenda of the event was simple, meet the Apiary team, learn about new products and enjoy some good food and beer!

It was great to see such a huge turnout at Node5. There were close to 50 people attending the event leading to really interesting conversations. The first 20 registrants were also "awarded" with cool Apiary T-shirts.

The evening started with Andrew, VP of enterprise products, introducing Apiary and API Blueprint to the audience. This was followed by Frantisek, front-end engineer, giving a sneak peek into our '**New Documentation**' and the editor preview feature of the new documentation. 

Andrew then gave a live demo of our [recently launched](http://blog.apiary.io/2014/10/22/Enterprise-Release/) '**Apiary for Enterprise product**'. 
In the end, Adam, lead developer of [**Dredd**](https://github.com/apiaryio/dredd), showed how to keep API documentation and Blueprint's release up-to-date with backend implementation.

For those of you who could not attend, we have video of their presentations.
