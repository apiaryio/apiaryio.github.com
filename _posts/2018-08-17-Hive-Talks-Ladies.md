## Hive Talks - Ladies' Edition

What to consider when transitioning into a career in tech? What types of roles are out there? What struggles lay ahead? How to make the best use of the existing skill set and experiences of those who made the jump?

Those will be some of the questions we'll try to answer together on this special edition of Hive Talks - the first Ladies' Edition meetup.

Is this event for me?

1. Have you been working in a technical position for a while already? Come and share your experience and knowledge.
2. Are you preparing to start a career in technology, or you're still considering it? Come and get answers to your questions.

We're open to welcoming non-ladies ;) If you have experience with those who transitioned into a technical position (e.g. you're a manager or a mentor), or you're looking to transition yourself - come join us!
