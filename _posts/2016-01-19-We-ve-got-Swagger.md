We love APIs. We always have and always will. We built Apiary to be the hub for
your API lifecycle. Until today, this place has spoken just one language:
API Blueprint. As of today, Apiary is bilingual... We’ve got Swagger!

Apiary has always been about being the best platform for your API lifecycle. We
have pushed the industry to take a design-first approach while making
documentation one of the most important components of delivering a great API. If
you are a passionate Swagger user, you can now join the community of 150,000 API
 heroes and design the best API regardless of your preferred language.

Just as developers choose a programming language for their use-case, we believe
you should be able to pick the API description language that best suits your
needs. Every individual has a preference for different tools and languages, but
the goal is the same: to build great APIs. Building great APIs is why Apiary
exists.

What about API Blueprint? We're committed to investing in the future of
API Blueprint, as it continues to be the primary way we will drive change and
innovation in the API design world. The [roadmap][roadmap] is now shared and
open, where you can see game-changing features like [MSON][mson] listed. If
you're a Swagger fan, we invite you to give API Blueprint a try.

Swagger support in Apiary is in beta—not all Apiary features are
[supported][features]. There is still more work to do. Support for testing and
validation will roll out later this year. We are also exploring ways for people
to move easily between the languages. Whichever description language you choose,
use Apiary as the design platform.

Swagger has been moved to OpenAPI Initiative, a neutral industry effort to find
interoperability between API tools. We welcome and support this goal and are
working towards joining OpenAPI Initiative as a member and technical
contributor. OpenAPI is based on Swagger 2.0 specification, and currently Apiary
 supports Swagger 2.0 out of the gate.

Questions? Ask away! We will be hosting a [webinar on February 2nd][webinar] to
give a live demo of the Swagger features. It will be followed it up with a Q&A
from our CEO and Founder. Hope to see you there!
