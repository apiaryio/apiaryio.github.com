After months of hard work and burning the midnight oil I am very proud to announce
the **ApiaryUI** - brand new, fully reviewed and refactored version of 
[Apiary Interactive Documentation v3](https://help.apiary.io/tools/interactive-documentation/) (v3).

ApiaryUI has already been deployed to [apiary.io](https://apiary.io/) on 20th of December 2018. 
ApiaryUI is currently in what we call EAP (Early Access Program).
Although it's already GA (Generally Available), it’s not yet fully production ready.
We want to share it with the world now and get the invaluable feedback from you - Apiary users.

ApiaryUI is implemented in a way, that allows complete separation from [apiary.io](https://apiary.io/)
and possibly forming a new separate product in the future. Some features from v3 are still missing
in ApiaryUI. Some requested features not present in v3 were implemented to ApiaryUI.
We’ve managed to fix tons of v3 bugs inside the new ApiaryUI. 

As the architecture of ApiaryUI is very simple and solid, we are able to add new features
and fix bugs in very rapid pace. Our extensive suite of unit, integration and e2e tests
are helping with that. This can finally release further evolution of the [API Blueprint](https://apiblueprint.org/) language.

We are currently in a process of creating the deprecation strategies for  
[Apiary Interactive Documentation v3](https://help.apiary.io/tools/interactive-documentation/)
and [Embed](https://help.apiary.io/tools/embed/). When we have those strategies fully formed
we'll announce them here, on the [Apiary Blog](https://blog.apiary.io/).


### What's new in ApiaryUI

ApiaryUI went through major product decisions. The concept of having three column layout stayed,
but we reorganized the information displayed on each of them. Human Column is now designed
to contain all the information needed for API Viewer to fully understand what the API is all about.
Machine Columns sole responsibility is to display machine processing related information
about one HTTP Transaction - Response/Request pair.

Although ApiaryUI exclusively uses [API Elements](https://apielements.org/) as data format, it can also consume
API Description Document (ADD) formats like [API Blueprint](https://apiblueprint.org/) or [OpenAPI 2.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md) ([OpenAPI 3.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md) coming soon)
and it parses the documents in Web Worker inside the browser. This means that ApiaryUI is completely
backend-less and does not need the server as it's backend.

#### Stability and predictability

ApiaryUI is React/Redux SPA (Single Page Application). We've used industry standard architectures
and patterns to produce simple and standardized codebase. As I mentioned earlier, our extensive
tests suite guarantees the stability of the ApiaryUI and makes further development predictable. 


#### Code highlighting

ApiaryUI highlights code examples in the following languages:

- Javascript
- JSON
- XML
- Python
- Ruby
- Java

#### Print support

ApiaryUI is fully print friendly. You can easily print the rendered documentation directly on paper or into PDF.


#### Accessibility

ApiaryUI complies with latest accessibility standards. We care about correctness of HTML semantics and proper use of Aria attributes.
ApiaryUI is compatible with screen readers and even specially-abled people should navigate in it with no problems.
Full support for touch events is guaranteed.

##### Keyboard navigation

ApiaryUI supports keyboard navigation for people who cannot use a mouse or other pointing device, 
or who want to use a keyboard as much as possible.


#### Mobile First (building for the future)

Mobile devices are already eclipsing desktops in adoption and internet use — that's why ApiaryUI was built from
the ground up to support any kind of device, any size screen, with any resolution. 
ApiaryUI behaves and looks differently on mobile and desktop resolutions to maximize the user experience. 

#### Error Boundaries

ApiaryUI has full support for error containment and reporting. When the ApiaryUI intercept an unexpected failure
it will contain it and display the Error Boundary view. This view contains button for downloading
the complete Error Report. 


### Next steps

#### Speed

We're currently parsing your API Description Documentation on every browser view. This makes
displaying of your API Projects via ApiaryUI unnecessarily slower. We plan to cache the result
of the parsing and skip the parsing phase of ApiaryUI. This should rapidly increase the
rendering times.  


#### Deprecation strategies

As I mentioned earlier, we are in the process of forming deprecation strategies for 
[Apiary Interactive Documentation v3](https://help.apiary.io/tools/interactive-documentation/) 
and [Embed](https://help.apiary.io/tools/embed/). 

#### Development of missing features

We'll be continuously delivering missing features from [Apiary Interactive Documentation v3](https://help.apiary.io/tools/interactive-documentation/) into ApiaryUI.
To learn more about the missing features, please refer to [ApiaryUI help page](https://help.apiary.io/tools/interactive-documentation-v4/).


I would like to wish all Apiary users Merry Christmas and Happy new Year. We are thrilled to 
welcome all Apiary users to try the new ApiaryUI - Interactive Documentation v4. 
Follow [this tutorial in Apiary Help](https://help.apiary.io/tools/interactive-documentation-v4/) to learn about how you can start using ApiaryUI on your Apiary projects today.
The help page also contains some additional information about features from Interactive Documentation v3
that are currently missing in ApiaryUI.


### Attributions

 I would like to give special thanks to Patrick Silva, Radek Podrazky and Standa Opichal.
These guys formed a core of new Documentation Team, did an exceptional job and make the delivery of ApiaryUI possible.

Thank you and keep up the good work!
