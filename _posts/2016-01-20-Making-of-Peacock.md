Recently, we have launched the biggest feature in the history of Apiary: [Swagger Support](http://blog.apiary.io/2016/01/18/We-ve-got-Swagger). This project was nicknamed "The Project Peacock".

It took us almost three months to implement it and prepare for the launch.
I would like to share with you few moments of the brave dogs, man and women
working at Apiary to bring you the best tools regardless of preferred API
Description format.
