# New API Blueprint Format
Apiary.io is maturing and as we grow so are our users' needs. We want to fuel the endless possibilities of where your API can go. We want to give you the best tools to design and maintain any REST-based API without boundaries or limits. Yet Apiary.io must also show the way to newcomers who are just tapping the API World. 

We are constantly evolving our API Blueprint Format and I would like to share with you the outlook on how it will evolve in the weeks to come.

## It is Markdown
We have decided to fully embrace Markdown for documenting your API. With the New API Blueprint Format your API documentation will be completely in pure Markdown excluding few extra [MultiMarkdown](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/) features. 

After all we are writing API documentation, not programming a backend in _yet another domain specific language_.

There will be no need for additional syntax-highlighting plug-in to your favorite text editor. Also rendering will suddenly be ubiquitous from your Markdown aware text editor to [GitHub GFM](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/) repositories. 

## Easier onboarding
With the New API Blueprint Format getting on board will be even easier. All in proper structural order, Markdown header specifying your endpoint followed by its discussion. 

## HUGE deal for big APIs
No more bloated API blueprints with lots repeated stuff packed into one document. We will minimize redundancy to zero and also introduce much-requested modularity. Here is what is new in API Blueprint Format to deal with complex, vast, APIs:

* Data Dictionaries
* Cross-References
* Dedicated Modules for Testing, Authentication, Tutorials and Storyboards. 
* Arbitrary User Modules (units)
* Inheritance

## Attributes 
New format will introduce support for discussing attributes including its type, default value and requirements.

## Hypermedia is good 
While we understand and have nothing but utmost respect for "pragmatic REST" I want to encourage considering RESTful approach from the early beginnings. If we would give you the right seamless tool to make real RESTful API with little extra effort would you opt to do so? 

## To the future and beyond
We will also deliver (or improve existing) support for **multimedia**, **multiple** **request** and **response** with improved schema support. This should be followed later by support for **authentication** an **pagination**. 

As you can see there are big changes ahead. For that I would like to ask you for your support. You can do so by voting on [New API Blueprint Format](http://support.apiary.io/forums/120125-general/suggestions/2970802-new-api-blueprint-format) and by leaving your comments and wishes there as well. Additionally you can contact me directly at z@apiary.io.

Also I would like to thanks to our awesome users that did already contribute with their comments and ideas. We only hope to make it easier for you to build the incredible REST API services only you can. 

I will be posting more about format changes in the upcoming weeks.
