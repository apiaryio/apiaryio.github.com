We have recently received a lot of feedback from users that would like to learn more about API Blueprint and how to present stunning and beautiful documentation.

We care about your feedback, and we think that documentation and tutorials about [API Blueprint](http://apiblueprint.org) are extremely important.

One of the most requested features was to have the ability to look to the other blueprints as a source of inspiration, and today this is possible for all public API Blueprints.

Whenever you're surfing a public blueprint, a new **API Blueprint** button will appear in header bar. Clicking this button will open up a new window with readable markdown, that can be easily grabbed, studied, modified and republished.

Sharing your API Blueprint with the community is very easy. Simply go to your API settings and ensure "Public Blueprint" switch is turned on.

We have many other great features on the horizon as well. As next step, we plan to merge this experience with our editor so that in a single click, you can open and edit the shared blueprint using our powerful tools.

What are you waiting for? View other public blueprints and share yours to give back!
