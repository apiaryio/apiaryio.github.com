Have you ever stumbled upon an API that was so beautifully documented and wondered, how did they do that? Well, at Apiary we believe that effective learning happens through socialization and collaboration. To help support this belief and the inspiration that stems from beautifully documented APIs, we added the ability to socialize blueprints

Whenever you're surfing a public blueprint, a new **API Blueprint** button will appear in header bar. Clicking this button will open up a new window with readable markdown, that can be easily grabbed, studied, modified and republished.

Start sharing your API blueprint with other API enthusiasts, by enabling this feature within your API settings. Simply toggle the 'Public Blueprint' setting on and you're ready to start socializing your API blueprint.

Socializing and learning from other public blueprints won't stop here. We have so many other great features in store to help promote learning through collaboration. Next, we plan to merge this experience with our editor so that in a single click, you can open and edit the shared blueprint using our powerful tools.

What are you waiting for? View other public blueprints and share yours to give back!
